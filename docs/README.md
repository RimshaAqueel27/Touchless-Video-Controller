2. Optimize images for web (< 1MB preferred)
3. Update README.md references
4. Credit original sources if applicable

## Demo Recording Tips

For creating demo GIFs:
1. Use tools like [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) or [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)
2. Record at 10-15 FPS for smaller file size
3. Keep duration under 10 seconds
4. Show clear gesture → action response
5. Optimize with [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/optimize)
